### Notes

* Discussed specifics of our structure if we create the Jupyter Foundation, in preparation for the EC governance proposal for vote.
* Discussed communicating to the community about JupyterCon financial results and future. A more detailed post is forthcoming, once we wrap up the logistical details with NumFOCUS. 
* Discussed that the EC needs to be better at taking notes and posting them publicly for transparency. Moving forward, we will be releasing public minutes more diligently.
